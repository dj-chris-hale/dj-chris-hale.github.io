Welcome to Ex-Patriot Recordings (Xp8r), the site, and recording label of Japan-based electronic music producer and Dj Chris Hale. 

Having come up through the underground electronic scene in Japan, where he has resided for nearly two-decades, his knowledge of the scene, and access to it's principal players, can be heard in his mixes and his own productions. 

He is also host of the underground radio show "Tokyo Metro" which was first broadcast on PulseRadio.net, and now podcasts from iTunes and other podcasting services. 

All of his own tracks and albums are available from the usual suspects: iTunes, Amazon Music and Spotify - available for stream or download.
