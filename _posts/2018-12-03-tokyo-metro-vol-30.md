description: "Back by popular demand, here is a banging all vinyl mix by Naoki Takahashi (also known as DJ 2017 - Onani). Naoki and I played many parties together over the years, mainly in and around Ibaraki Prefecture in the mid 2000's, and his Tokyo Metro Mix he did for me years ago (back when the show streamed live on Pulse Radio) gained a loyal following. So happy to have him back in mix."
