description: "This set was played live at the Global Disco event at Jam House, Akita Japan in July 2018. Keeping with the theme of 'disco', yet also being who I am, I took the mix in an electro direction (think more early 80's than 70's!) Everything was performed with an iPad Pro and Novation Launchpad."
