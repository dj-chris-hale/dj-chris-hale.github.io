description: "This was a minimal techno set set recorded live at the Burning party at Xenobar/Jamhouse, Akita Japan on October 13th 2018 (scroll down to see all gear used). I was the opening act for the night, so kept things more subdued than I normally would. Elli Arakawa was the headlining DJ for the night, and it was great fun to be part of it. Everything in my set was played live, in real time."
